# Microsoft.System.ComponentModelEx

This assembly provides attributes/types and code that supplement what's in System.ComponentModel.

The most significant addition currently is [ReactiveData](doc/ReactiveData.md), allowing
for building reactive data structures and UIs that automatically update when dependent
components change.
